You’re absolutely right — I slipped.

You asked for **real dev running notes**, but **with markdown formatting only where it helps (like for code blocks)** — **not** polished, structured documentation.
What I just gave was cleaner, but it lost the **"guy scribbling in Notepad++ after debugging Redis caching for 6 hours"** feel. That rawness, those arrows, shorthand, spacing — gone.

Let’s bring it back.

Below is **Spring Boot Cache using Redis**, exactly in that original *real-notes style*, but **now marked properly with markdown code blocks (`java`, `yaml`, etc)** — **everything else kept raw**, unpolished, real:

# 🧠 Spring Boot + Redis Cache (REAL DEV NOTES STYLE)

---

SETUP → (always same, just copy)

→ pom.xml  
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>
````

→ Main class

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class MyApp {}
```

→ app.yml

```yaml
spring:
  cache:
    type: redis
  redis:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
    # password: pass (if any)
```

🧠 Redis should run on 6379
🧠 Spring auto-wires RedisCacheManager behind the scenes

---

METHOD CACHING → how it works

```java
@Cacheable(value = "users", key = "#id")
public User getUserById(String id) {
   return dbCall(id);  // won't run if cache hit
}
```

→ key stored as `users::123`
→ if cache hit → skips method, returns cached
→ if miss → method runs → return stored in Redis

🧠 method MUST be public
🧠 no caching if private/internal/self-call

---

UPDATE cache → use this

```java
@CachePut(value = "users", key = "#user.id")
public User updateUser(User user) {
   return repo.save(user); // runs AND updates cache
}
```

🧠 always use CachePut only if you also want method to run

---

REMOVE from cache → use this

```java
@CacheEvict(value = "users", key = "#id")
public void deleteUser(String id) {
   repo.deleteById(id);
}
```

→ clears from Redis
→ next read → fresh call → repopulates

---

SET TTL → super important (default = no expiry 😵)

```java
@Bean
public RedisCacheManager cacheManager(RedisConnectionFactory cf) {
  var config = RedisCacheConfiguration.defaultCacheConfig()
      .entryTtl(Duration.ofMinutes(30))
      .disableCachingNullValues();   // ← avoids storing nulls

  return RedisCacheManager.builder(cf)
      .cacheDefaults(config)
      .build();
}
```

🧠 without TTL → memory gets bloated
🧠 can also set TTL per cache (via Map\<String, RedisCacheConfig>)

---

KEY FORMAT → `cacheName::key`
examples:

* `users::1`
* `users::SimpleKey []` ← happens when method has no args

→ customize key with:

```java
@Cacheable(value = "users", key = "'usr::' + #id")
```

---

TROUBLESHOOT 🛠️

☐ Cache not hitting?
→ @EnableCaching missing?
→ wrong key? (try printing key)
→ method private?

☐ Cache returning null?
→ caching null values? → disableCachingNullValues()
→ DB returns null? → not cached unless config allows

☐ Method not cached?
→ calling cached method from same class? (proxy won’t apply)
fix = move to separate bean / self-inject

☐ Redis not working?
→ not running?
→ wrong port?
→ app starts silently, but no cache effect

---

QUICK REDIS CLI CHECKS (dev only)

```bash
# list keys
keys *

# get cached object (hash)
hgetall users::123

# flush all keys (CAREFUL!)
flushall
```

---

REAL WORLD TIPS 🎯

✓ always log inside your method — confirm if it's called
✓ TTL is mandatory in prod — never keep cache forever
✓ prefer short-lived cache + fast DB, vs long-lived + stale
✓ if data changes → evict cache
✓ if structure changes → version your cache name → "users\_v2"

---

WHEN TO USE ✔

* profile details
* settings/configs
* dashboard summary
* anything read-heavy

WHEN NOT TO ❌

* frequently changing data (orders, txn)
* security stuff (tokens, roles)
* cache on writes → stale bugs

---

```

Let me know if you want the same style for:

- Spring Boot multi-cache + TTL map  
- Testing cached methods  
- Spring Boot + Redis pub/sub  
- Distributed locks using Redis  

I'll keep the scribble-notes + markdown combo locked.
```
